One person was killed in a car crash on Friday near South Australia\\u2019s capital city of Adelaide where an emergency warning is in place, though the precise circumstances surrounding the death is not yet clear. Australia has been fighting wildfires across three states for weeks, with blazes destroying more than 700 homes and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland. The death of the two firefighters overnight when their fire truck was struck by a falling tree as it traveled through the front line of a fire brought the fires death toll in New South Wales to eight since the start of October. Ten more firefighters were seriously injured on Thursday, with four in South Australia being treated for burns and smoke inhalation. \\u201cThe worst imaginable set of circumstances unfolded,\\u201d New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. \\u201cThis hurts everybody to the core.\\u201d  Shortly after the pair\\u2019s deaths were announced, Morrison issued a statement saying he would return as soon as possible from a family holiday in Hawaii, a trip that has drawn sharp criticism in recent days as the wildfires crisis deepened. \\u201cI deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,\\u201d Morrison said in the statement. Morrison later told 2GB radio that the trip had been planned as a surprise to his young daughters to replace leave originally scheduled for January that he had canceled because of official trips to Japan and India. His return comes as firefighters prepare for \\u201ccatastrophic\\u201d fire danger - the most severe level - in NSW on Saturday as searing heat and high winds are forecast, leading officials to urge people to evacuate their homes early if they live close to bushland. \\u201cIt is a fairly strong likelihood that we will lose homes tomorrow, it would be a miracle if we don\\u2019t,\\u201d RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers told reporters in Sydney. There are more than 200 fires burning across Australia - 70 of which are classified as uncontrolled, mostly in NSW. In South Australia, more than 120 blazes have broken out in catastrophic conditions. Bracing for more potential fatalities, authorities said an emergency fire in Lameroo, 210 km (130.5 miles) east of Adelaide may pose a threat to lives directly in its path and urged residents to flee now. Morrison\\u2019s conservative Liberal-National coalition government has been under sustained pressure to defend its climate change policies as it has downplayed links to the unprecedented early arrival and severity of this year\\u2019s bushfire season. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Morrison\\u2019s Sydney residence on Thursday. One protestor, wearing an Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, \\u201cScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?\\u201d referencing the leader\\u2019s nickname and a well-known international advertisement for Tourism Australia. Australia is one of the world\\u2019s largest carbon emitters per capita because of its reliance on coal-fired power plants. It has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but critics accuse Morrison of paying lip service to that commitment. In June, the government approved the construction of a new coal mine in Queensland state by India\\u2019s Adani Enterprises that is expected to produce 8 million to 10 million tonnes of thermal coal a year. As Morrison was apologizing on radio on Friday morning, opposition Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese was serving breakfast to firefighters near the front line of a fire in rural Bilpin. The fires have resulted in days of heavy pollution in Sydney, pushing air quality to unprecedented hazardous levels and resulting in viral images of heavy smoke haze over the usually sparkling harbor and landmarks like the Opera House. The fires are being spurred this week, by record temperatures across the country which led NSW, the most populous state with 7 million people, to declare a seven-day state of emergency. Thursday\\u2019s declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities. Days out from Christmas, a time when many Australians head to the coast for the holidays, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people to reconsider travel plans. \\u201cWhat is most important for us is that everyone is safe and if that means changing your plans for Christmas, we ask you do to that,\\u201d Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.

Ryan is 25 years old and on 6/19/01was sun-tanning with friends on the roof of the condo in Southern California where he lives. There is a skylight on the roof and nobody knows exactly how, because his friends were walking ahead of him, but Ryan accidentally fell through the skylight to a cement floor more than 3 stories below. He struck some stairway guardrails on the way down, which helped break his fall, but he hit the floor with such an impact that paramedics who arrived on the scene thought he was beyond hope. In the intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center, there were other moments when hope seemed to be beyond reach, but Ryan has miraculously survived minute-by-minute from collapsed lungs, kidney failure, heart stoppage, having his spleen removed, and brain surgery. His skull was crushed in the fall but, amazingly, there were no other broken bones. Comments\",\n          \"Girl Scout cookies don\\u2019t fund Planned Parenthood. Also, contrary to many allegations, Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA), the national organization, doesn\\u2019t have a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Some regional Girl Scout councils have, however, partnered with Planned Parenthood\\u00a0to provide sex education in the past. The first call for a Girl Scout cookie boycott came in 2004 from Pro-Life Waco, a Texas-based pro-life organization. The group became angry when a local council offered a sex education program in partnership with\\u00a0a Planned Parenthood office in Waco. The confrontation led to a showdown between leaders of Pro-Life Waco and then-Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Kathy Clonginger on the \\u201cToday\\u201d show in March 2004. In a transcript of the exchange, Clogninger defended the council\\u2019s decision: The Girl Scouts in Waco, Texas, really made a decision based on local community context, they decided that in this particular situation that it would be in the best interest of girls and their families to discontinue the relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts is the largest voice for, and advocate for girls across the country. Know that girls grow up with very complex issues facing them. And so we do, across the country, tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the thing that\\u2019s girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring\\u00a0information-based sex education programs to girls. \\u2026It\\u2019s really impossible for girls to grow up in today\\u2019s society with out having access to good information. We will continue to partner with organizations across this nation, and local community Girl Scouts will make decisions based on their local community partnerships and the needs of their girls and their families. Clonginger didn\\u2019t\\u00a0acknowledge a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood, and there\\u2019s no evidence that there ever was one. GSUSA says that the national chapter \\u201cdoes not take a position to develop materials\\u201d or programs regarding human sexuality, birth control or abortion. Rather, those decisions are made at the local level by parents, volunteers and council members: Parents or guardians make all decisions regarding program participation that may be of a\\u00a0sensitive nature. Consistent with that belief, GSUSA directs councils, including volunteer\\u00a0leaders, to get written parental permission for any locally planned program that could be\\u00a0considered sensitive. In 2014, GSUSA CEO Anna Maria Chavez denied a\\u00a0national relationship between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood in a YouTube video: We do not now, nor have we ever, had a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts of the USA believes that reproductive issues are deeply private matters, best left to families. I find it unsettling that anyone would use the Girl Scout brand to have very adult conversations. A box of Girl Scout cookies is not a political statement; it\\u2019s an investment in a little girl\\u2026 Given Clonginger\\u2019s earlier remarks, Chavez\\u2019s statement has caused some confusion. The simple explanation is that Clonginger acknowledge local \\u201crelationships\\u201d between councils and Planned Parenthood while\\u00a0Chavez denied a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood. There\\u2019s also been some confusion about where money from Girl Scout cookie sales go. A sale proceeds from local troops stay within local councils. GSUSA doesn\\u2019t get a cut of the revenue, but it does get\\u00a0licensing royalties from bakers\\u00a0of the cookies: Girl Scout troops and groups must pool their proceeds to pay for program supplies, activities, and\\u00a0group travel. Girl Scouts may not earn proceeds as individuals; however, Girl Scout councils offer a\\u00a0wide variety of recognition items, program- and store-related credits, and travel experiences that girls\\u00a0are eligible to earn individually based on their sales. All troop proceeds and other rewards earned\\u00a0through participation in the Girl Scout Cookie Program must be used to enhance each girl\\u2019s Girl\\u00a0Scout experience. Each Girl Scout council releases an annual report each year. The only\\u00a0way to know how your local council spends those dollars is to review its annual report, or to ask a local staff member.

Ralph Northam gave in 2019 about a bill in the Virginia House of Delegates regulating third-trimester abortions. \\\"This bill was allowing a mother in labor, in the process of delivering a child, this bill would allow a doctor to kill that child instead of delivering that child in the midst of labor,\\\" Cruz said. \\\"The idea of killing a child while the mother is in labor instead of delivering the infant is horrifying beyond words.\\\" Cruz\\u2019s claim that Democrats support abortion up until birth and \\\"even, horrifically, after that,\\\" is inaccurate, as is his characterization of the Virginia proposal (which was unsuccessful). Trump claims This isn\\u2019t the first time a Republican leader has used an inaccurate description of the Virginia bill to advance legislation to require care for infants \\\"born alive\\\" after attempted abortions. When Senate Republicans attempted to pass a version of the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act in February 2019, President Donald Trump offered two inaccurate claims on this front. Speaking at a rally in El Paso, he said that Northam \\\"stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world ... then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby.\\\" We rated this claim . In a tweet sent days later, Trump said: \\\"The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don\\u2019t mind executing babies AFTER birth.\\\" We rated that claim . To be clear: killing an infant after birth is illegal, and people on both sides of the abortion debate agree that this act should be illegal. Under federal law, the definitions of a person, human being, child and individual all include infants \\\"born alive at any stage of development.\\\" Virginia legislation This characterization of Democrats as supporters of allowing abortions during and after a live birth surfaced in early 2019, when a subcommittee of the Virginia House of Delegates considered a bill aimed at loosening the state\\u2019s abortion laws. In Virginia, a woman can choose to obtain an abortion through the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, up to 28 weeks from her last menstrual period. After that point, abortions are legal if they happen in a hospital and three physicians certify that \\\"the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman.\\\" The law also requires physicians to make \\\"measures for life support for the product of such abortion\\\" available if there is \\\"any clearly visible evidence of viability\\\" after an attempted abortion. The bill Virginia lawmakers considered in 2019 proposed multiple changes to state laws addressing abortion, including the provision regulating the procedure in the third trimester. The proposal would have lowered the number of physicians required to authorize a third-trimester abortion from three to one and remove the \\\"substantial and irremediable\\\" threshold in the law. At the time of the debate, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that there were two confirmed third-trimester abortions performed in Virginia since 2000. Republican lawmakers questioned the bill\\u2019s sponsor on the scope of the proposal, asking whether the measure would allow a woman who is dilating to get a abortion. \\\"My bill would allow that,\\\" said Democratic lawmaker Kathy Tran. \\\"Yes.\\\" Her response sparked intense backlash from anti-abortion advocates and footage of her remark circulated quickly on social media. But days later, Tran said she misspoke: \\\"I should have said: \\u2018Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.\\u2019\\\" A spokeswoman for Cruz pointed to the language of Tran\\u2019s bill and said it clearly allows abortion up until the moment of birth, but Tran\\u2019s bill only changed the requirements in place before a doctor can perform a third-trimester abortion. It did not change the law as it relates to when such an abortion could take place. As the law stands, abortion is legal in the third trimester only in cases where three physicians certify that the mother\\u2019s life is in danger. Virginia law prohibits \\\"partial birth infanticide,\\\" the killing of an infant who has \\\"been born alive, but who has not been completely extracted or expelled from its mother.\\\" Northam\\u2019s comments In a radio interview two days after the debate, Northam discussed the legislation and offered a confusing comment about third-trimester abortions: \\\"It\\u2019s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\\u2019s nonviable. So, in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\\\" A number of anti-abortion advocates accused the Democratic governor of approving the killing of infants. Northam rejected this characterization of his remarks and a spokesperson said the comments were about options for care available to women with a nonviable pregnancy or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality. This can include issues like anencephaly, when an infant is born without parts of the brain and skull, and limb-body wall complex, when an infant's organs have developed outside of its body. In these cases, where there is \\\"little or no prospect\\\" of an infant surviving after birth, families might opt for perinatal palliative care, or comfort care \\u2014 prioritizing comfort while allowing an infant to die naturally without exercising full resuscitation efforts. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes this care as existing on a spectrum of care, \\\"which includes pregnancy termination (abortion) and full neonatal resuscitation and treatment.\\\" Cruz\\u2019s spokeswoman pointed to this care as an example of a doctor completing an abortion by denying medical care. This type of care is rare \\u2014 a study of deaths at children\\u2019s hospitals found that while neonates represented 41% of all deaths, perinatal palliative care was only utilized in 2% of cases \\u2014 and does not meet the definition of abortion. Harvard Medical School defines abortion as \\\"the removal of pregnancy tissue, products of conception or the fetus and placenta (afterbirth) from the uterus.\\\" Our Ruling Cruz said Democrats support \\\"abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that.\\\" Cruz\\u2019s remark hinged on an inaccurate characterization of legislation considered in Virginia\\u2019s House of Delegates in 2019 and comments made by the state\\u2019s Democratic governor at the same time. State law in Virginia allows doctors to perform abortions up until the moment of birth, but only in cases when three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman. The author of the bill clarified earlier remarks to say it would not allow an abortion to be performed on a woman during a live birth. PolitiFact has rated multiple statements making similar claims about Democrats supporting the execution of children . Cruz's statement is based on an inaccurate characterization of a bill considered in Virginia's House of Delegates, which would have changed requirements needed before doctors could perform an aboriton during the third-trimester of pregnancy. In Virginia, abortions are allowed at this late point if\\u00a0three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman. The author of the bill, which was unsuccessful, said her proposed changes would not allow an abortion to be performed on a woman during a live birth. Any attempt at aborting or killing an infant after birth is illegal.\",\n          \"A video shows a sick, possibly starving polar bear on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. In December 2017, a viral video left millions of people saddened and horrified by the sight of an emaciated polar bear forced to scavenge in trash cans for food on Canada\\u2019s Baffin Island. Photographer Paul Nicklen posted the video on Facebook, garnering almost 30,000 shares within a week, as well as the attention of the national news media. Nicklen, who is also co-founder of the environmental nonprofit group SeaLegacy, wrote: My entire\\u00a0Sea Legacy\\u00a0team was pushing through their tears and emotions while documenting this dying polar bear. It\\u2019s a soul-crushing scene that still haunts me, but I know we need to share both the beautiful and the heartbreaking if we are going to break down the walls of apathy. This is what starvation looks like. The muscles atrophy. No energy. It\\u2019s a slow, painful death. When scientists say polar bears will be extinct in the next 100 years, I think of the global population\\u00a0of 25,000 bears dying in this manner. There is no band aid solution. There was no saving this individual bear. People think that we can put platforms in the ocean or we can feed the odd starving bear. The simple truth is this \\u2014 if the Earth continues to warm, we will lose bears and entire polar ecosystems. The video was subsequently shared by National Geographic, which reported: Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear\\u2019s back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. The footage is real. Nicklen says it was captured \\u201ca few months\\u201d before December 2017, at an abandoned Inuit camp on Baffin Island, the enormous land mass southwest of Greenland in the Canadian Arctic. There appears to be no doubt that the animal is suffering from starvation, as National Geographic wrote: The bear\\u2019s thin frame and protruding bones are clear indicators of this, and its atrophied muscles suggest it\\u2019s been starving for an extended period of time. However, the causes of the bear\\u2019s condition were a little bit more complicated. Polar bears live only in the Arctic and eat only meat, their main source being seals. They rely on Arctic seawater to freeze into ice, where they can gain access to seals. But climate change means that these Arctic ice sheets are reducing in size, lowering the number of seals available to polar bears and ultimately, causing them to starve. The risk is higher in places like Baffin Island, where polar bears depend on seasonal ice. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the issue is likely about to become dramatically worse: Recent predictions suggest that\\u00a0warming seawater\\u00a0and air will melt 20 percent or more of the Arctic\\u2019s ice cover in the next 40 years \\u2014 a scary statistic for the many species in the Arctic that rely on seasonal ice cover for vital activities such as breeding and eating. However, Dr. Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for the non-profit Polar Bears International, said in a blog post that climate change may not have been the direct or sole contributing factor in this particular animal\\u2019s demise:\\u00a0 Polar bears have few natural predators. Although they normally live a long time, they are not immortal. All eventually die and most do so because they have not been able to capture enough food. This means that malnutrition is a major cause of death for polar bears. Young bears that have not learned well enough how to catch seals, old feeble bears, and bears that have injured themselves, all can succumb to malnutrition under some circumstances. The starvation leading to the event shown in this video could be related to old age, injury (like a broken jaw or teeth that prevent it from catching food), disease, or other factors limiting its success in obtaining prey. However, Amstrup points out that the continued diminishment of sea ice that is expected will make it harder for polar bears in this region to find seals to eat, and therefore make starvation much more likely for sick, lame, very young or very old animals who might otherwise have survived: The problem is that an ever-warmer future means polar bears will have less and less access to their seal prey, so the rate at which bears die from malnutrition/starvation will increase. So, regardless of the proximate cause of this bear\\u2019s condition, this heart-wrenching footage provides us with a warning about the future. Hunters from Inuit communities on Baffin Island were also skeptical over whether to link the bear\\u2019s condition with climate change; Eric Ootoovak, the vice-chair of the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization, said of the bear: You can really tell he\\u2019s sick. He\\u2019s not starving. If he was starving, he\\u2019d be able to move a bit more than that. Nick Arnalukjuak, who leads a similar group in the island community of Nunavut, called it part of a \\u201cnormal cycle\\u201d for some bears to suffer injury or illness, adding: We don\\u2019t have starving polar bears, we don\\u2019t have polar bears facing hard times because of ice. As long as we have four seasons \\u2014 spring, summer, fall, winter \\u2014 nothing\\u2019s going to change.\",\n          \"\\u201cOn February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.\\u201d National shortages of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment have exacerbated concerns that U.S. doctors and nurses are not getting the supplies needed to help COVID-19 patients. The surging demand for masks led President Donald Trump to charge, without evidence, that the equipment earmarked for New York\\u2019s hospitals has been \\\"going out the back door.\\\" But some people are pointing the blame back at Trump, who downplayed the threat of the virus early on despite warnings from experts about the health care system\\u2019s readiness. One claim we\\u2019ve heard from politicians, TV commentators and social media users is that the U.S. gave away medical supplies that are now sorely needed at home. \\\"On February 7, the (World Health Organization) warned about the limited stock of PPE,\\\" said a March 31 Facebook post, using an acronym for personal protective equipment. \\\"That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China. Now our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.\\\" The post from Blue Dem Warriors was flagged as part of Facebook\\u2019s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the information is largely accurate. The State Department announced on Feb. 7 that it had \\\"facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.\\\" The Facebook post cited as its source of information a CNN editorial criticizing the shipment. The move came more than two weeks after the first U.S. coronavirus case was detected in Washington state on Jan. 21. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Feb. 7 that the delivery would \\\"help save lives\\\" in China, which had reported more than 31,000 cases by then. We have coordinated with U.S. organizations to transport more humanitarian relief to people in Wuhan. Personal protective equipment and other medical supplies donated by these organizations can help save lives in #China and help protect people from the #coronavirus. pic.twitter.com/57SN2TXfLP Pompeo touted the assistance again in remarks to reporters on March 31, saying it was an example of American generosity and part of an effort to keep the virus contained to China. The materials sent to China, Pompeo said, were donated by Samaritan\\u2019s Purse, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and other private organizations. Boeing and Intermountain Healthcare were also involved, according to a Feb. 15 State Department press release. On Feb. 7, the State Department also pledged to commit up to $100 million in existing funds to assist China and other countries. A State Department spokesperson told us the $100 million promise has been fulfilled with funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. aid to date also includes about $110 million in humanitarian assistance for up to 64 different countries and roughly $64 million in refugee-related assistance for the United Nations. The spokesperson told us the security and health of Americans comes first, but that \\\"the spread of COVID-19 is a threat to our shared international security\\\" and that efforts aimed at responding to the virus abroad are also meant to help mitigate the spread in the U.S. We won\\u2019t weigh in on whether the distribution of donated protective equipment to China was the right move. But the Facebook post is correct that the U.S. announced the delivery in February. Other fact-checkers said the same about a similar claim from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. The Facebook post also notes that the timing of the China shipment coincided with a press conference in which the World Health Organization sounded the alarm about a \\\"limited stock\\\" of personal protective equipment. That\\u2019s accurate. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Feb. 7 of a potential supply shortage across the globe and especially in China. The warning was for the world, not the U.S. in particular. \\\"The world is facing severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment,\\\" Ghebreyesus said. \\\"Demand is up to 100 times higher than normal and prices are up to 20 times higher.\\\" Ghebreyesus said the situation was made worse by people outside of patient care using masks, for example. He said health workers and caretakers should be first to receive items from the limited stock, and that health workers in China needed \\\"the bulk of PPE supplies.\\\" \\\"WHO discourages stockpiling of (personal protective equipment) in countries and areas where transmission is low,\\\" he said. The Facebook post closes by saying \\\"our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.\\\" News reports indicate that some health workers \\u2014 who are at an increased risk of exposure \\u2014 are among the more than 200,000 infected Americans and over 4,500 who have died. Doctors and nurses have made shortages known and are tweeting the hashtag #GetMePPE. Some medical supplies are now coming into the U.S. from abroad. The White House arranged for the transport of tons of equipment from China, and the New England Patriots recently lent its team plane to pick up 1.2 million N95 masks from China for Massachusetts\\u2019 health workers. We asked the State Department whether any of the donated materials sent to China in February made their way back to the U.S., and whether the donations would have gone straight to U.S. hospitals had they not been shipped overseas. We didn\\u2019t get answers to those questions. A Facebook post said: \\\"On February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.\\\" The State Department announced the delivery of nearly 18 tons of donated materials on Feb. 7, the same day that the WHO sounded the alarm about the world\\u2019s supply of personal protective equipment. The donated materials came from private groups. The State Department announced Feb. 7 that it had \\u201cfacilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people.\\u201d   The same day, the WHO director general said, \\u201cThere is limited stock of (personal protective equipment) and we need to make sure we get it to the people who need it most in the places that need it most,\\u201d citing health care workers and caretakers.

One person was killed in a car crash on Friday near South Australia\\u2019s capital city of Adelaide where an emergency warning is in place, though the precise circumstances surrounding the death is not yet clear. Australia has been fighting wildfires across three states for weeks, with blazes destroying more than 700 homes and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland. The death of the two firefighters overnight when their fire truck was struck by a falling tree as it traveled through the front line of a fire brought the fires death toll in New South Wales to eight since the start of October. Ten more firefighters were seriously injured on Thursday, with four in South Australia being treated for burns and smoke inhalation. \\u201cThe worst imaginable set of circumstances unfolded,\\u201d New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. \\u201cThis hurts everybody to the core.\\u201d  Shortly after the pair\\u2019s deaths were announced, Morrison issued a statement saying he would return as soon as possible from a family holiday in Hawaii, a trip that has drawn sharp criticism in recent days as the wildfires crisis deepened. \\u201cI deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,\\u201d Morrison said in the statement. Morrison later told 2GB radio that the trip had been planned as a surprise to his young daughters to replace leave originally scheduled for January that he had canceled because of official trips to Japan and India. His return comes as firefighters prepare for \\u201ccatastrophic\\u201d fire danger - the most severe level - in NSW on Saturday as searing heat and high winds are forecast, leading officials to urge people to evacuate their homes early if they live close to bushland. \\u201cIt is a fairly strong likelihood that we will lose homes tomorrow, it would be a miracle if we don\\u2019t,\\u201d RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers told reporters in Sydney. There are more than 200 fires burning across Australia - 70 of which are classified as uncontrolled, mostly in NSW. In South Australia, more than 120 blazes have broken out in catastrophic conditions. Bracing for more potential fatalities, authorities said an emergency fire in Lameroo, 210 km (130.5 miles) east of Adelaide may pose a threat to lives directly in its path and urged residents to flee now. Morrison\\u2019s conservative Liberal-National coalition government has been under sustained pressure to defend its climate change policies as it has downplayed links to the unprecedented early arrival and severity of this year\\u2019s bushfire season. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Morrison\\u2019s Sydney residence on Thursday. One protestor, wearing an Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, \\u201cScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?\\u201d referencing the leader\\u2019s nickname and a well-known international advertisement for Tourism Australia. Australia is one of the world\\u2019s largest carbon emitters per capita because of its reliance on coal-fired power plants. It has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but critics accuse Morrison of paying lip service to that commitment. In June, the government approved the construction of a new coal mine in Queensland state by India\\u2019s Adani Enterprises that is expected to produce 8 million to 10 million tonnes of thermal coal a year. As Morrison was apologizing on radio on Friday morning, opposition Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese was serving breakfast to firefighters near the front line of a fire in rural Bilpin. The fires have resulted in days of heavy pollution in Sydney, pushing air quality to unprecedented hazardous levels and resulting in viral images of heavy smoke haze over the usually sparkling harbor and landmarks like the Opera House. The fires are being spurred this week, by record temperatures across the country which led NSW, the most populous state with 7 million people, to declare a seven-day state of emergency. Thursday\\u2019s declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities. Days out from Christmas, a time when many Australians head to the coast for the holidays, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people to reconsider travel plans. \\u201cWhat is most important for us is that everyone is safe and if that means changing your plans for Christmas, we ask you do to that,\\u201d Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.

He struck some stairway guardrails on the way down, which helped break his fall, but he hit the floor with such an impact that paramedics who arrived on the scene thought he was beyond hope. In the intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center, there were other moments when hope seemed to be beyond reach, but Ryan has miraculously survived minute-by-minute from collapsed lungs, kidney failure, heart stoppage, having his spleen removed, and brain surgery.

Also, contrary to many allegations, Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA), the national organization, doesn\\u2019t have a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Some regional Girl Scout councils have, however, partnered with Planned Parenthood\\u00a0to provide sex education in the past. The first call for a Girl Scout cookie boycott came in 2004 from Pro-Life Waco, a Texas-based pro-life organization. The group became angry when a local council offered a sex education program in partnership with\\u00a0a Planned Parenthood office in Waco. The confrontation led to a showdown between leaders of Pro-Life Waco and then-Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Kathy Clonginger on the \\u201cToday\\u201d show in March 2004. In a transcript of the exchange, Clogninger defended the council\\u2019s decision: The Girl Scouts in Waco, Texas, really made a decision based on local community context, they decided that in this particular situation that it would be in the best interest of girls and their families to discontinue the relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts is the largest voice for, and advocate for girls across the country. Know that girls grow up with very complex issues facing them. And so we do, across the country, tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the thing that\\u2019s girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring\\u00a0information-based sex education programs to girls. \\u2026It\\u2019s really impossible for girls to grow up in today\\u2019s society with out having access to good information. We will continue to partner with organizations across this nation, and local community Girl Scouts will make decisions based on their local community partnerships and the needs of their girls and their families. Clonginger didn\\u2019t\\u00a0acknowledge a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood, and there\\u2019s no evidence that there ever was one. GSUSA says that the national chapter \\u201cdoes not take a position to develop materials\\u201d or programs regarding human sexuality, birth control or abortion. Rather, those decisions are made at the local level by parents, volunteers and council members: Parents or guardians make all decisions regarding program participation that may be of a\\u00a0sensitive nature. Consistent with that belief, GSUSA directs councils, including volunteer\\u00a0leaders, to get written parental permission for any locally planned program that could be\\u00a0considered sensitive. In 2014, GSUSA CEO Anna Maria Chavez denied a\\u00a0national relationship between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood in a YouTube video: We do not now, nor have we ever, had a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts of the USA believes that reproductive issues are deeply private matters, best left to families. I find it unsettling that anyone would use the Girl Scout brand to have very adult conversations. A box of Girl Scout cookies is not a political statement; it\\u2019s an investment in a little girl\\u2026 Given Clonginger\\u2019s earlier remarks, Chavez\\u2019s statement has caused some confusion. The simple explanation is that Clonginger acknowledge local \\u201crelationships\\u201d between councils and Planned Parenthood while\\u00a0Chavez denied a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood. There\\u2019s also been some confusion about where money from Girl Scout cookie sales go. A sale proceeds from local troops stay within local councils. GSUSA doesn\\u2019t get a cut of the revenue, but it does get\\u00a0licensing royalties from bakers\\u00a0of the cookies: Girl Scout troops and groups must pool their proceeds to pay for program supplies, activities, and\\u00a0group travel. Girl Scouts may not earn proceeds as individuals; however, Girl Scout councils offer a\\u00a0wide variety of recognition items, program- and store-related credits, and travel experiences that girls\\u00a0are eligible to earn individually based on their sales. All troop proceeds and other rewards earned\\u00a0through participation in the Girl Scout Cookie Program must be used to enhance each girl\\u2019s Girl\\u00a0Scout experience. Each Girl Scout council releases an annual report each year. The only\\u00a0way to know how your local council spends those dollars is to review its annual report, or to ask a local staff member.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke in favor of the efforts from the Senate floor. In his remarks, Cruz urged his Democratic colleagues to support these kinds of \\\"common sense propositions,\\\" a departure from the party\\u2019s \\\"extreme\\\" position on abortion. Neither bill \\u2014 versions of which GOP lawmakers have attempted to pass several times over multiple years \\u2014 was approved. \\\"We\\u2019ve seen far too many Democrats embrace extreme positions on abortion: abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that,\\\" Cruz said, before highlighting a radio interview Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam gave in 2019 about a bill in the Virginia House of Delegates regulating third-trimester abortions. \\\"This bill was allowing a mother in labor, in the process of delivering a child, this bill would allow a doctor to kill that child instead of delivering that child in the midst of labor,\\\" Cruz said. \\\"The idea of killing a child while the mother is in labor instead of delivering the infant is horrifying beyond words.\\\" Cruz\\u2019s claim that Democrats support abortion up until birth and \\\"even, horrifically, after that,\\\" is inaccurate, as is his characterization of the Virginia proposal (which was unsuccessful). Trump claims This isn\\u2019t the first time a Republican leader has used an inaccurate description of the Virginia bill to advance legislation to require care for infants \\\"born alive\\\" after attempted abortions. When Senate Republicans attempted to pass a version of the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act in February 2019, President Donald Trump offered two inaccurate claims on this front. Speaking at a rally in El Paso, he said that Northam \\\"stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world ... then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby.\\\" We rated this claim . In a tweet sent days later, Trump said: \\\"The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don\\u2019t mind executing babies AFTER birth.\\\" We rated that claim . To be clear: killing an infant after birth is illegal, and people on both sides of the abortion debate agree that this act should be illegal. Under federal law, the definitions of a person, human being, child and individual all include infants \\\"born alive at any stage of development.\\\" Virginia legislation This characterization of Democrats as supporters of allowing abortions during and after a live birth surfaced in early 2019, when a subcommittee of the Virginia House of Delegates considered a bill aimed at loosening the state\\u2019s abortion laws. In Virginia, a woman can choose to obtain an abortion through the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, up to 28 weeks from her last menstrual period. After that point, abortions are legal if they happen in a hospital and three physicians certify that \\\"the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman.\\\" The law also requires physicians to make \\\"measures for life support for the product of such abortion\\\" available if there is \\\"any clearly visible evidence of viability\\\" after an attempted abortion. The bill Virginia lawmakers considered in 2019 proposed multiple changes to state laws addressing abortion, including the provision regulating the procedure in the third trimester. The proposal would have lowered the number of physicians required to authorize a third-trimester abortion from three to one and remove the \\\"substantial and irremediable\\\" threshold in the law. At the time of the debate, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that there were two confirmed third-trimester abortions performed in Virginia since 2000. Republican lawmakers questioned the bill\\u2019s sponsor on the scope of the proposal, asking whether the measure would allow a woman who is dilating to get a abortion. \\\"My bill would allow that,\\\" said Democratic lawmaker Kathy Tran. \\\"Yes.\\\" Her response sparked intense backlash from anti-abortion advocates and footage of her remark circulated quickly on social media. But days later, Tran said she misspoke: \\\"I should have said: \\u2018Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.\\u2019\\\" A spokeswoman for Cruz pointed to the language of Tran\\u2019s bill and said it clearly allows abortion up until the moment of birth, but Tran\\u2019s bill only changed the requirements in place before a doctor can perform a third-trimester abortion. It did not change the law as it relates to when such an abortion could take place. As the law stands, abortion is legal in the third trimester only in cases where three physicians certify that the mother\\u2019s life is in danger. Virginia law prohibits \\\"partial birth infanticide,\\\" the killing of an infant who has \\\"been born alive, but who has not been completely extracted or expelled from its mother.\\\" Northam\\u2019s comments In a radio interview two days after the debate, Northam discussed the legislation and offered a confusing comment about third-trimester abortions: \\\"It\\u2019s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\\u2019s nonviable. So, in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\\\" A number of anti-abortion advocates accused the Democratic governor of approving the killing of infants. Northam rejected this characterization of his remarks and a spokesperson said the comments were about options for care available to women with a nonviable pregnancy or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality. This can include issues like anencephaly, when an infant is born without parts of the brain and skull, and limb-body wall complex, when an infant's organs have developed outside of its body. In these cases, where there is \\\"little or no prospect\\\" of an infant surviving after birth, families might opt for perinatal palliative care, or comfort care \\u2014 prioritizing comfort while allowing an infant to die naturally without exercising full resuscitation efforts. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes this care as existing on a spectrum of care, \\\"which includes pregnancy termination (abortion) and full neonatal resuscitation and treatment.\\\" Cruz\\u2019s spokeswoman pointed to this care as an example of a doctor completing an abortion by denying medical care. This type of care is rare \\u2014 a study of deaths at children\\u2019s hospitals found that while neonates represented 41% of all deaths, perinatal palliative care was only utilized in 2% of cases \\u2014 and does not meet the definition of abortion. Harvard Medical School defines abortion as \\\"the removal of pregnancy tissue, products of conception or the fetus and placenta (afterbirth) from the uterus.\\\" Our Ruling Cruz said Democrats support \\\"abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that.\\\" Cruz\\u2019s remark hinged on an inaccurate characterization of legislation considered in Virginia\\u2019s House of Delegates in 2019 and comments made by the state\\u2019s Democratic governor at the same time. State law in Virginia allows doctors to perform abortions up until the moment of birth, but only in cases when three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman. The author of the bill clarified earlier remarks to say it would not allow an abortion to be performed on a woman during a live birth. PolitiFact has rated multiple statements making similar claims about Democrats supporting the execution of children . Cruz's statement is based on an inaccurate characterization of a bill considered in Virginia's House of Delegates, which would have changed requirements needed before doctors could perform an aboriton during the third-trimester of pregnancy.

Any attempt at aborting or killing an infant after birth is illegal.\",\n          \"A video shows a sick, possibly starving polar bear on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. In December 2017, a viral video left millions of people saddened and horrified by the sight of an emaciated polar bear forced to scavenge in trash cans for food on Canada\\u2019s Baffin Island. Photographer Paul Nicklen posted the video on Facebook, garnering almost 30,000 shares within a week, as well as the attention of the national news media. Nicklen, who is also co-founder of the environmental nonprofit group SeaLegacy, wrote: My entire\\u00a0Sea Legacy\\u00a0team was pushing through their tears and emotions while documenting this dying polar bear. It\\u2019s a soul-crushing scene that still haunts me, but I know we need to share both the beautiful and the heartbreaking if we are going to break down the walls of apathy. This is what starvation looks like. The muscles atrophy. No energy. It\\u2019s a slow, painful death. When scientists say polar bears will be extinct in the next 100 years, I think of the global population\\u00a0of 25,000 bears dying in this manner. There is no band aid solution. There was no saving this individual bear. People think that we can put platforms in the ocean or we can feed the odd starving bear. The simple truth is this \\u2014 if the Earth continues to warm, we will lose bears and entire polar ecosystems. The video was subsequently shared by National Geographic, which reported: Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear\\u2019s back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. The footage is real. Nicklen says it was captured \\u201ca few months\\u201d before December 2017, at an abandoned Inuit camp on Baffin Island, the enormous land mass southwest of Greenland in the Canadian Arctic. There appears to be no doubt that the animal is suffering from starvation, as National Geographic wrote: The bear\\u2019s thin frame and protruding bones are clear indicators of this, and its atrophied muscles suggest it\\u2019s been starving for an extended period of time. However, the causes of the bear\\u2019s condition were a little bit more complicated. Polar bears live only in the Arctic and eat only meat, their main source being seals. They rely on Arctic seawater to freeze into ice, where they can gain access to seals. But climate change means that these Arctic ice sheets are reducing in size, lowering the number of seals available to polar bears and ultimately, causing them to starve. The risk is higher in places like Baffin Island, where polar bears depend on seasonal ice. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the issue is likely about to become dramatically worse: Recent predictions suggest that\\u00a0warming seawater\\u00a0and air will melt 20 percent or more of the Arctic\\u2019s ice cover in the next 40 years \\u2014 a scary statistic for the many species in the Arctic that rely on seasonal ice cover for vital activities such as breeding and eating. However, Dr. Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for the non-profit Polar Bears International, said in a blog post that climate change may not have been the direct or sole contributing factor in this particular animal\\u2019s demise:\\u00a0 Polar bears have few natural predators. Although they normally live a long time, they are not immortal. All eventually die and most do so because they have not been able to capture enough food. This means that malnutrition is a major cause of death for polar bears. Young bears that have not learned well enough how to catch seals, old feeble bears, and bears that have injured themselves, all can succumb to malnutrition under some circumstances. The starvation leading to the event shown in this video could be related to old age, injury (like a broken jaw or teeth that prevent it from catching food), disease, or other factors limiting its success in obtaining prey. However, Amstrup points out that the continued diminishment of sea ice that is expected will make it harder for polar bears in this region to find seals to eat, and therefore make starvation much more likely for sick, lame, very young or very old animals who might otherwise have survived: The problem is that an ever-warmer future means polar bears will have less and less access to their seal prey, so the rate at which bears die from malnutrition/starvation will increase. So, regardless of the proximate cause of this bear\\u2019s condition, this heart-wrenching footage provides us with a warning about the future. Hunters from Inuit communities on Baffin Island were also skeptical over whether to link the bear\\u2019s condition with climate change; Eric Ootoovak, the vice-chair of the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization, said of the bear: You can really tell he\\u2019s sick. He\\u2019s not starving. If he was starving, he\\u2019d be able to move a bit more than that. Nick Arnalukjuak, who leads a similar group in the island community of Nunavut, called it part of a \\u201cnormal cycle\\u201d for some bears to suffer injury or illness, adding: We don\\u2019t have starving polar bears, we don\\u2019t have polar bears facing hard times because of ice. As long as we have four seasons \\u2014 spring, summer, fall, winter \\u2014 nothing\\u2019s going to change.\",\n          \"\\u201cOn February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.\\u201d National shortages of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment have exacerbated concerns that U.S. doctors and nurses are not getting the supplies needed to help COVID-19 patients. The surging demand for masks led President Donald Trump to charge, without evidence, that the equipment earmarked for New York\\u2019s hospitals has been \\\"going out the back door.\\\" But some people are pointing the blame back at Trump, who downplayed the threat of the virus early on despite warnings from experts about the health care system\\u2019s readiness. One claim we\\u2019ve heard from politicians, TV commentators and social media users is that the U.S. gave away medical supplies that are now sorely needed at home. \\\"On February 7, the (World Health Organization) warned about the limited stock of PPE,\\\" said a March 31 Facebook post, using an acronym for personal protective equipment. \\\"That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China. Now our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.\\\" The post from Blue Dem Warriors was flagged as part of Facebook\\u2019s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the information is largely accurate. The State Department announced on Feb. 7 that it had \\\"facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.\\\" The Facebook post cited as its source of information a CNN editorial criticizing the shipment. The move came more than two weeks after the first U.S. coronavirus case was detected in Washington state on Jan. 21. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Feb. 7 that the delivery would \\\"help save lives\\\" in China, which had reported more than 31,000 cases by then. We have coordinated with U.S. organizations to transport more humanitarian relief to people in Wuhan. Personal protective equipment and other medical supplies donated by these organizations can help save lives in #China and help protect people from the #coronavirus. pic.twitter.com/57SN2TXfLP Pompeo touted the assistance again in remarks to reporters on March 31, saying it was an example of American generosity and part of an effort to keep the virus contained to China. The materials sent to China, Pompeo said, were donated by Samaritan\\u2019s Purse, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and other private organizations. Boeing and Intermountain Healthcare were also involved, according to a Feb. 15 State Department press release. On Feb. 7, the State Department also pledged to commit up to $100 million in existing funds to assist China and other countries. A State Department spokesperson told us the $100 million promise has been fulfilled with funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. aid to date also includes about $110 million in humanitarian assistance for up to 64 different countries and roughly $64 million in refugee-related assistance for the United Nations. The spokesperson told us the security and health of Americans comes first, but that \\\"the spread of COVID-19 is a threat to our shared international security\\\" and that efforts aimed at responding to the virus abroad are also meant to help mitigate the spread in the U.S. We won\\u2019t weigh in on whether the distribution of donated protective equipment to China was the right move. But the Facebook post is correct that the U.S. announced the delivery in February. Other fact-checkers said the same about a similar claim from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. The Facebook post also notes that the timing of the China shipment coincided with a press conference in which the World Health Organization sounded the alarm about a \\\"limited stock\\\" of personal protective equipment. That\\u2019s accurate. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Feb. 7 of a potential supply shortage across the globe and especially in China. The warning was for the world, not the U.S. in particular. \\\"The world is facing severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment,\\\" Ghebreyesus said. \\\"Demand is up to 100 times higher than normal and prices are up to 20 times higher.\\\" Ghebreyesus said the situation was made worse by people outside of patient care using masks, for example. He said health workers and caretakers should be first to receive items from the limited stock, and that health workers in China needed \\\"the bulk of PPE supplies.\\\" \\\"WHO discourages stockpiling of (personal protective equipment) in countries and areas where transmission is low,\\\" he said. The Facebook post closes by saying \\\"our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.\\\" News reports indicate that some health workers \\u2014 who are at an increased risk of exposure \\u2014 are among the more than 200,000 infected Americans and over 4,500 who have died. Doctors and nurses have made shortages known and are tweeting the hashtag #GetMePPE. Some medical supplies are now coming into the U.S. from abroad. The White House arranged for the transport of tons of equipment from China, and the New England Patriots recently lent its team plane to pick up 1.2 million N95 masks from China for Massachusetts\\u2019 health workers. We asked the State Department whether any of the donated materials sent to China in February made their way back to the U.S., and whether the donations would have gone straight to U.S. hospitals had they not been shipped overseas. We didn\\u2019t get answers to those questions. A Facebook post said: \\\"On February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.\\\" The State Department announced the delivery of nearly 18 tons of donated materials on Feb. 7, the same day that the WHO sounded the alarm about the world\\u2019s supply of personal protective equipment. The donated materials came from private groups. The State Department announced Feb. 7 that it had \\u201cfacilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people.\\u201d   The same day, the WHO director general said, \\u201cThere is limited stock of (personal protective equipment) and we need to make sure we get it to the people who need it most in the places that need it most,\\u201d citing health care workers and caretakers. A State Department spokesperson told us efforts aimed at responding to the threat of the coronavirus overseas also help mitigate the spread in the U.S.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 501,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4164,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 802,\n        \"samples\": [\n          918,\n          1091,\n          464\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

One person was killed in a car crash on Friday near South Australia\\u2019s capital city of Adelaide where an emergency warning is in place, though the precise circumstances surrounding the death is not yet clear. Australia has been fighting wildfires across three states for weeks, with blazes destroying more than 700 homes and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland. The death of the two firefighters overnight when their fire truck was struck by a falling tree as it traveled through the front line of a fire brought the fires death toll in New South Wales to eight since the start of October. Ten more firefighters were seriously injured on Thursday, with four in South Australia being treated for burns and smoke inhalation. \\u201cThe worst imaginable set of circumstances unfolded,\\u201d New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. \\u201cThis hurts everybody to the core.\\u201d  Shortly after the pair\\u2019s deaths were announced, Morrison issued a statement saying he would return as soon as possible from a family holiday in Hawaii, a trip that has drawn sharp criticism in recent days as the wildfires crisis deepened. \\u201cI deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,\\u201d Morrison said in the statement. Morrison later told 2GB radio that the trip had been planned as a surprise to his young daughters to replace leave originally scheduled for January that he had canceled because of official trips to Japan and India. His return comes as firefighters prepare for \\u201ccatastrophic\\u201d fire danger - the most severe level - in NSW on Saturday as searing heat and high winds are forecast, leading officials to urge people to evacuate their homes early if they live close to bushland. \\u201cIt is a fairly strong likelihood that we will lose homes tomorrow, it would be a miracle if we don\\u2019t,\\u201d RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers told reporters in Sydney. There are more than 200 fires burning across Australia - 70 of which are classified as uncontrolled, mostly in NSW. In South Australia, more than 120 blazes have broken out in catastrophic conditions. Bracing for more potential fatalities, authorities said an emergency fire in Lameroo, 210 km (130.5 miles) east of Adelaide may pose a threat to lives directly in its path and urged residents to flee now. Morrison\\u2019s conservative Liberal-National coalition government has been under sustained pressure to defend its climate change policies as it has downplayed links to the unprecedented early arrival and severity of this year\\u2019s bushfire season. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Morrison\\u2019s Sydney residence on Thursday. One protestor, wearing an Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, \\u201cScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?\\u201d referencing the leader\\u2019s nickname and a well-known international advertisement for Tourism Australia. Australia is one of the world\\u2019s largest carbon emitters per capita because of its reliance on coal-fired power plants. It has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, but critics accuse Morrison of paying lip service to that commitment. In June, the government approved the construction of a new coal mine in Queensland state by India\\u2019s Adani Enterprises that is expected to produce 8 million to 10 million tonnes of thermal coal a year. As Morrison was apologizing on radio on Friday morning, opposition Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese was serving breakfast to firefighters near the front line of a fire in rural Bilpin. The fires have resulted in days of heavy pollution in Sydney, pushing air quality to unprecedented hazardous levels and resulting in viral images of heavy smoke haze over the usually sparkling harbor and landmarks like the Opera House. The fires are being spurred this week, by record temperatures across the country which led NSW, the most populous state with 7 million people, to declare a seven-day state of emergency. Thursday\\u2019s declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities. Days out from Christmas, a time when many Australians head to the coast for the holidays, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people to reconsider travel plans. \\u201cWhat is most important for us is that everyone is safe and if that means changing your plans for Christmas, we ask you do to that,\\u201d Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.

Ryan is 25 years old and on 6/19/01was sun-tanning with friends on the roof of the condo in Southern California where he lives. There is a skylight on the roof and nobody knows exactly how, because his friends were walking ahead of him, but Ryan accidentally fell through the skylight to a cement floor more than 3 stories below. He struck some stairway guardrails on the way down, which helped break his fall, but he hit the floor with such an impact that paramedics who arrived on the scene thought he was beyond hope. In the intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center, there were other moments when hope seemed to be beyond reach, but Ryan has miraculously survived minute-by-minute from collapsed lungs, kidney failure, heart stoppage, having his spleen removed, and brain surgery. His skull was crushed in the fall but, amazingly, there were no other broken bones. Comments\",\n          \"Girl Scout cookies don\\u2019t fund Planned Parenthood. Also, contrary to many allegations, Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA), the national organization, doesn\\u2019t have a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Some regional Girl Scout councils have, however, partnered with Planned Parenthood\\u00a0to provide sex education in the past. The first call for a Girl Scout cookie boycott came in 2004 from Pro-Life Waco, a Texas-based pro-life organization. The group became angry when a local council offered a sex education program in partnership with\\u00a0a Planned Parenthood office in Waco. The confrontation led to a showdown between leaders of Pro-Life Waco and then-Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Kathy Clonginger on the \\u201cToday\\u201d show in March 2004. In a transcript of the exchange, Clogninger defended the council\\u2019s decision: The Girl Scouts in Waco, Texas, really made a decision based on local community context, they decided that in this particular situation that it would be in the best interest of girls and their families to discontinue the relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts is the largest voice for, and advocate for girls across the country. Know that girls grow up with very complex issues facing them. And so we do, across the country, tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the thing that\\u2019s girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring\\u00a0information-based sex education programs to girls. \\u2026It\\u2019s really impossible for girls to grow up in today\\u2019s society with out having access to good information. We will continue to partner with organizations across this nation, and local community Girl Scouts will make decisions based on their local community partnerships and the needs of their girls and their families. Clonginger didn\\u2019t\\u00a0acknowledge a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood, and there\\u2019s no evidence that there ever was one. GSUSA says that the national chapter \\u201cdoes not take a position to develop materials\\u201d or programs regarding human sexuality, birth control or abortion. Rather, those decisions are made at the local level by parents, volunteers and council members: Parents or guardians make all decisions regarding program participation that may be of a\\u00a0sensitive nature. Consistent with that belief, GSUSA directs councils, including volunteer\\u00a0leaders, to get written parental permission for any locally planned program that could be\\u00a0considered sensitive. In 2014, GSUSA CEO Anna Maria Chavez denied a\\u00a0national relationship between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood in a YouTube video: We do not now, nor have we ever, had a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts of the USA believes that reproductive issues are deeply private matters, best left to families. I find it unsettling that anyone would use the Girl Scout brand to have very adult conversations. A box of Girl Scout cookies is not a political statement; it\\u2019s an investment in a little girl\\u2026 Given Clonginger\\u2019s earlier remarks, Chavez\\u2019s statement has caused some confusion. The simple explanation is that Clonginger acknowledge local \\u201crelationships\\u201d between councils and Planned Parenthood while\\u00a0Chavez denied a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood. There\\u2019s also been some confusion about where money from Girl Scout cookie sales go. A sale proceeds from local troops stay within local councils. GSUSA doesn\\u2019t get a cut of the revenue, but it does get\\u00a0licensing royalties from bakers\\u00a0of the cookies: Girl Scout troops and groups must pool their proceeds to pay for program supplies, activities, and\\u00a0group travel. Girl Scouts may not earn proceeds as individuals; however, Girl Scout councils offer a\\u00a0wide variety of recognition items, program- and store-related credits, and travel experiences that girls\\u00a0are eligible to earn individually based on their sales. All troop proceeds and other rewards earned\\u00a0through participation in the Girl Scout Cookie Program must be used to enhance each girl\\u2019s Girl\\u00a0Scout experience. Each Girl Scout council releases an annual report each year. The only\\u00a0way to know how your local council spends those dollars is to review its annual report, or to ask a local staff member.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke in favor of the efforts from the Senate floor. In his remarks, Cruz urged his Democratic colleagues to support these kinds of \\\"common sense propositions,\\\" a departure from the party\\u2019s \\\"extreme\\\" position on abortion. Neither bill \\u2014 versions of which GOP lawmakers have attempted to pass several times over multiple years \\u2014 was approved. \\\"We\\u2019ve seen far too many Democrats embrace extreme positions on abortion: abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that,\\\" Cruz said, before highlighting a radio interview Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam gave in 2019 about a bill in the Virginia House of Delegates regulating third-trimester abortions. \\\"This bill was allowing a mother in labor, in the process of delivering a child, this bill would allow a doctor to kill that child instead of delivering that child in the midst of labor,\\\" Cruz said. \\\"The idea of killing a child while the mother is in labor instead of delivering the infant is horrifying beyond words.\\\" Cruz\\u2019s claim that Democrats support abortion up until birth and \\\"even, horrifically, after that,\\\" is inaccurate, as is his characterization of the Virginia proposal (which was unsuccessful). Trump claims This isn\\u2019t the first time a Republican leader has used an inaccurate description of the Virginia bill to advance legislation to require care for infants \\\"born alive\\\" after attempted abortions. When Senate Republicans attempted to pass a version of the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act in February 2019, President Donald Trump offered two inaccurate claims on this front. Speaking at a rally in El Paso, he said that Northam \\\"stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world ... then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby.\\\" We rated this claim . In a tweet sent days later, Trump said: \\\"The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don\\u2019t mind executing babies AFTER birth.\\\" We rated that claim . To be clear: killing an infant after birth is illegal, and people on both sides of the abortion debate agree that this act should be illegal. Under federal law, the definitions of a person, human being, child and individual all include infants \\\"born alive at any stage of development.\\\" Virginia legislation This characterization of Democrats as supporters of allowing abortions during and after a live birth surfaced in early 2019, when a subcommittee of the Virginia House of Delegates considered a bill aimed at loosening the state\\u2019s abortion laws. In Virginia, a woman can choose to obtain an abortion through the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, up to 28 weeks from her last menstrual period. After that point, abortions are legal if they happen in a hospital and three physicians certify that \\\"the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman.\\\" The law also requires physicians to make \\\"measures for life support for the product of such abortion\\\" available if there is \\\"any clearly visible evidence of viability\\\" after an attempted abortion. The bill Virginia lawmakers considered in 2019 proposed multiple changes to state laws addressing abortion, including the provision regulating the procedure in the third trimester. The proposal would have lowered the number of physicians required to authorize a third-trimester abortion from three to one and remove the \\\"substantial and irremediable\\\" threshold in the law. At the time of the debate, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that there were two confirmed third-trimester abortions performed in Virginia since 2000. Republican lawmakers questioned the bill\\u2019s sponsor on the scope of the proposal, asking whether the measure would allow a woman who is dilating to get a abortion. \\\"My bill would allow that,\\\" said Democratic lawmaker Kathy Tran. \\\"Yes.\\\" Her response sparked intense backlash from anti-abortion advocates and footage of her remark circulated quickly on social media. But days later, Tran said she misspoke: \\\"I should have said: \\u2018Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.\\u2019\\\" A spokeswoman for Cruz pointed to the language of Tran\\u2019s bill and said it clearly allows abortion up until the moment of birth, but Tran\\u2019s bill only changed the requirements in place before a doctor can perform a third-trimester abortion. It did not change the law as it relates to when such an abortion could take place. As the law stands, abortion is legal in the third trimester only in cases where three physicians certify that the mother\\u2019s life is in danger. Virginia law prohibits \\\"partial birth infanticide,\\\" the killing of an infant who has \\\"been born alive, but who has not been completely extracted or expelled from its mother.\\\" Northam\\u2019s comments In a radio interview two days after the debate, Northam discussed the legislation and offered a confusing comment about third-trimester abortions: \\\"It\\u2019s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\\u2019s nonviable. So, in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\\\" A number of anti-abortion advocates accused the Democratic governor of approving the killing of infants. Northam rejected this characterization of his remarks and a spokesperson said the comments were about options for care available to women with a nonviable pregnancy or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality. This can include issues like anencephaly, when an infant is born without parts of the brain and skull, and limb-body wall complex, when an infant's organs have developed outside of its body. In these cases, where there is \\\"little or no prospect\\\" of an infant surviving after birth, families might opt for perinatal palliative care, or comfort care \\u2014 prioritizing comfort while allowing an infant to die naturally without exercising full resuscitation efforts. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes this care as existing on a spectrum of care, \\\"which includes pregnancy termination (abortion) and full neonatal resuscitation and treatment.\\\" Cruz\\u2019s spokeswoman pointed to this care as an example of a doctor completing an abortion by denying medical care. This type of care is rare \\u2014 a study of deaths at children\\u2019s hospitals found that while neonates represented 41% of all deaths, perinatal palliative care was only utilized in 2% of cases \\u2014 and does not meet the definition of abortion. Harvard Medical School defines abortion as \\\"the removal of pregnancy tissue, products of conception or the fetus and placenta (afterbirth) from the uterus.\\\" Our Ruling Cruz said Democrats support \\\"abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that.\\\" Cruz\\u2019s remark hinged on an inaccurate characterization of legislation considered in Virginia\\u2019s House of Delegates in 2019 and comments made by the state\\u2019s Democratic governor at the same time. State law in Virginia allows doctors to perform abortions up until the moment of birth, but only in cases when three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman. The author of the bill clarified earlier remarks to say it would not allow an abortion to be performed on a woman during a live birth. PolitiFact has rated multiple statements making similar claims about Democrats supporting the execution of children . Cruz's statement is based on an inaccurate characterization of a bill considered in Virginia's House of Delegates, which would have changed requirements needed before doctors could perform an aboriton during the third-trimester of pregnancy. In Virginia, abortions are allowed at this late point if\\u00a0three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman. The author of the bill, which was unsuccessful, said her proposed changes would not allow an abortion to be performed on a woman during a live birth. Any attempt at aborting or killing an infant after birth is illegal.\",\n          \"A video shows a sick, possibly starving polar bear on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. In December 2017, a viral video left millions of people saddened and horrified by the sight of an emaciated polar bear forced to scavenge in trash cans for food on Canada\\u2019s Baffin Island. Photographer Paul Nicklen posted the video on Facebook, garnering almost 30,000 shares within a week, as well as the attention of the national news media. Nicklen, who is also co-founder of the environmental nonprofit group SeaLegacy, wrote: My entire\\u00a0Sea Legacy\\u00a0team was pushing through their tears and emotions while documenting this dying polar bear. It\\u2019s a soul-crushing scene that still haunts me, but I know we need to share both the beautiful and the heartbreaking if we are going to break down the walls of apathy. This is what starvation looks like. The muscles atrophy. No energy. It\\u2019s a slow, painful death. When scientists say polar bears will be extinct in the next 100 years, I think of the global population\\u00a0of 25,000 bears dying in this manner. There is no band aid solution. There was no saving this individual bear. People think that we can put platforms in the ocean or we can feed the odd starving bear. The simple truth is this \\u2014 if the Earth continues to warm, we will lose bears and entire polar ecosystems. The video was subsequently shared by National Geographic, which reported: Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear\\u2019s back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. The footage is real. Nicklen says it was captured \\u201ca few months\\u201d before December 2017, at an abandoned Inuit camp on Baffin Island, the enormous land mass southwest of Greenland in the Canadian Arctic. There appears to be no doubt that the animal is suffering from starvation, as National Geographic wrote: The bear\\u2019s thin frame and protruding bones are clear indicators of this, and its atrophied muscles suggest it\\u2019s been starving for an extended period of time. However, the causes of the bear\\u2019s condition were a little bit more complicated. Polar bears live only in the Arctic and eat only meat, their main source being seals. They rely on Arctic seawater to freeze into ice, where they can gain access to seals. But climate change means that these Arctic ice sheets are reducing in size, lowering the number of seals available to polar bears and ultimately, causing them to starve. The risk is higher in places like Baffin Island, where polar bears depend on seasonal ice. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the issue is likely about to become dramatically worse: Recent predictions suggest that\\u00a0warming seawater\\u00a0and air will melt 20 percent or more of the Arctic\\u2019s ice cover in the next 40 years \\u2014 a scary statistic for the many species in the Arctic that rely on seasonal ice cover for vital activities such as breeding and eating. However, Dr. Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for the non-profit Polar Bears International, said in a blog post that climate change may not have been the direct or sole contributing factor in this particular animal\\u2019s demise:\\u00a0 Polar bears have few natural predators. Although they normally live a long time, they are not immortal. All eventually die and most do so because they have not been able to capture enough food. This means that malnutrition is a major cause of death for polar bears. Young bears that have not learned well enough how to catch seals, old feeble bears, and bears that have injured themselves, all can succumb to malnutrition under some circumstances. The starvation leading to the event shown in this video could be related to old age, injury (like a broken jaw or teeth that prevent it from catching food), disease, or other factors limiting its success in obtaining prey. However, Amstrup points out that the continued diminishment of sea ice that is expected will make it harder for polar bears in this region to find seals to eat, and therefore make starvation much more likely for sick, lame, very young or very old animals who might otherwise have survived: The problem is that an ever-warmer future means polar bears will have less and less access to their seal prey, so the rate at which bears die from malnutrition/starvation will increase. So, regardless of the proximate cause of this bear\\u2019s condition, this heart-wrenching footage provides us with a warning about the future. Hunters from Inuit communities on Baffin Island were also skeptical over whether to link the bear\\u2019s condition with climate change; Eric Ootoovak, the vice-chair of the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization, said of the bear: You can really tell he\\u2019s sick. He\\u2019s not starving. If he was starving, he\\u2019d be able to move a bit more than that. Nick Arnalukjuak, who leads a similar group in the island community of Nunavut, called it part of a \\u201cnormal cycle\\u201d for some bears to suffer injury or illness, adding: We don\\u2019t have starving polar bears, we don\\u2019t have polar bears facing hard times because of ice. As long as we have four seasons \\u2014 spring, summer, fall, winter \\u2014 nothing\\u2019s going to change.\",\n          \"\\u201cOn February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.\\u201d National shortages of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment have exacerbated concerns that U.S. doctors and nurses are not getting the supplies needed to help COVID-19 patients. The surging demand for masks led President Donald Trump to charge, without evidence, that the equipment earmarked for New York\\u2019s hospitals has been \\\"going out the back door.\\\" But some people are pointing the blame back at Trump, who downplayed the threat of the virus early on despite warnings from experts about the health care system\\u2019s readiness. One claim we\\u2019ve heard from politicians, TV commentators and social media users is that the U.S. gave away medical supplies that are now sorely needed at home. \\\"On February 7, the (World Health Organization) warned about the limited stock of PPE,\\\" said a March 31 Facebook post, using an acronym for personal protective equipment. \\\"That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China. Now our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.\\\" The post from Blue Dem Warriors was flagged as part of Facebook\\u2019s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the information is largely accurate. The State Department announced on Feb. 7 that it had \\\"facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.\\\" The Facebook post cited as its source of information a CNN editorial criticizing the shipment. The move came more than two weeks after the first U.S. coronavirus case was detected in Washington state on Jan. 21. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Feb. 7 that the delivery would \\\"help save lives\\\" in China, which had reported more than 31,000 cases by then. We have coordinated with U.S. organizations to transport more humanitarian relief to people in Wuhan. Personal protective equipment and other medical supplies donated by these organizations can help save lives in #China and help protect people from the #coronavirus. pic.twitter.com/57SN2TXfLP Pompeo touted the assistance again in remarks to reporters on March 31, saying it was an example of American generosity and part of an effort to keep the virus contained to China. The materials sent to China, Pompeo said, were donated by Samaritan\\u2019s Purse, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and other private organizations. Boeing and Intermountain Healthcare were also involved, according to a Feb. 15 State Department press release. On Feb. 7, the State Department also pledged to commit up to $100 million in existing funds to assist China and other countries. A State Department spokesperson told us the $100 million promise has been fulfilled with funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. aid to date also includes about $110 million in humanitarian assistance for up to 64 different countries and roughly $64 million in refugee-related assistance for the United Nations. The spokesperson told us the security and health of Americans comes first, but that \\\"the spread of COVID-19 is a threat to our shared international security\\\" and that efforts aimed at responding to the virus abroad are also meant to help mitigate the spread in the U.S. We won\\u2019t weigh in on whether the distribution of donated protective equipment to China was the right move. But the Facebook post is correct that the U.S. announced the delivery in February. Other fact-checkers said the same about a similar claim from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. The Facebook post also notes that the timing of the China shipment coincided with a press conference in which the World Health Organization sounded the alarm about a \\\"limited stock\\\" of personal protective equipment. That\\u2019s accurate. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Feb. 7 of a potential supply shortage across the globe and especially in China. The warning was for the world, not the U.S. in particular. \\\"The world is facing severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment,\\\" Ghebreyesus said. \\\"Demand is up to 100 times higher than normal and prices are up to 20 times higher.\\\" Ghebreyesus said the situation was made worse by people outside of patient care using masks, for example. He said health workers and caretakers should be first to receive items from the limited stock, and that health workers in China needed \\\"the bulk of PPE supplies.\\\" \\\"WHO discourages stockpiling of (personal protective equipment) in countries and areas where transmission is low,\\\" he said. The Facebook post closes by saying \\\"our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.\\\" News reports indicate that some health workers \\u2014 who are at an increased risk of exposure \\u2014 are among the more than 200,000 infected Americans and over 4,500 who have died. Doctors and nurses have made shortages known and are tweeting the hashtag #GetMePPE. Some medical supplies are now coming into the U.S. from abroad. The White House arranged for the transport of tons of equipment from China, and the New England Patriots recently lent its team plane to pick up 1.2 million N95 masks from China for Massachusetts\\u2019 health workers. We asked the State Department whether any of the donated materials sent to China in February made their way back to the U.S., and whether the donations would have gone straight to U.S. hospitals had they not been shipped overseas. We didn\\u2019t get answers to those questions. A Facebook post said: \\\"On February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.\\\" The State Department announced the delivery of nearly 18 tons of donated materials on Feb. 7, the same day that the WHO sounded the alarm about the world\\u2019s supply of personal protective equipment.
